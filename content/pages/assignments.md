Apart from doing the weekly [Readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings), students are required to complete three types of assignments for this course:

*   **Oral presentation**: Students are required to present on the weekly theme for one session (they will choose which session they will present upon on the first day of class). Presentations will be given either individually or in pairs and should be limited to 10 minutes maximum. During the presentation, students will be required to speak to the class rather than read a pre-written text.
*   **Short-answer papers**: For the sessions in the table below with a question listed, students will be required to write a short, half-page argument in response to the question (which in turn relates to the weekly theme).
*   **Creative video project**: Students will complete a creative video project based on a piece of art selected by each student at the Museum of Fine Arts. Students will first visit the MFA and select a work of art related to French culture and society.

They will then write a one page paper explaining why they chose that work of art. Finally, they will create a video that will explore to what extent the work they selected would have been different if it were an American one. The video should be 5 min maximum, and students are strongly encouraged to submit their 1 page outline before they start recording the video. The video will be submitted two weeks before the end of classes.
